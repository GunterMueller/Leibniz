Leibniz System Software. Forked from "https://www.utdallas.edu/~klaus/Leibnizprogram/leibnizmain.html"


    The Leibniz System is a software package for the development and implementation of logic-based intelligent systems. The package covers various aspect of the construction of such systems with modules for

    - logic computation
    - learning logic formulas from data
    - discretization of data
    - subgroup discovery from data
    - data estimation by a lazy learner
    - dimension reduction of models
    - decomposition of graphs and matrices
    - solution of constrained optimization problems involving single or multiple objective functions

    All programs are written in C using the ANSI standard. Installation is intended under Linux/Unix. Installation using other operating systems should not be difficult but is not covered in the manual.

    For a first look at the system, get the Leibniz System manual.

    The Leibniz System originally was companion software for the book "Design of Logic-based Intelligent Systems" by K. Truemper, published by Wiley, 2004. Anybody purchasing the book was licensed to download the original version and use it for commercial or noncommmercial applications, without any additional charge or license fee.

    Since then, the Leibniz System has been significantly expanded and the requirement of book purchase has been removed. Instead, the system is now made available without charge under the GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL), which is much less restrictive than the General Public License (GPL). In fact, the adjective "Lesser" is a misnomer. Instead, it should say "More General Public License" since so much more can be done under the LGPL than under the GPL.

    The file lgpl.txt supplied with the installation files has the precise definition of LGPL. Informally speaking, the LGPL allows the modules of the Leibniz System to be "linked with ... a non-(L)GPLed program, regardless of whether it is free software or proprietary software. The non-(L)GPLed program can then be distributed under any terms if it is not a derivative work" (Wikipedia). In simple language, the Leibniz System can be freely and without charge used by or incorporated into noncommercial, or commercial, or public, or proprietary software, as long as that software is not derivative work and the use of the Leibniz System under the LGPL is acknowledged; see Chapter 1 of the manual for the citation. Here, "not derivative" means that the software using the Leibniz System must differ in a non-trivial way from the Leibniz System software and doesn't constitute just a trivial reuse of the software under another name.

    One may download the Leibniz System only if one agrees to the above conditions.

Downloading and Installation of Leibniz System

    Get the files leibniz.complete.zip and installation.pdf.

    Install the Leibniz System using the instructions in the file installation.pdf.

    Optional: Send email to klaus@utdallas.edu with "Leibniz System Download" in the subject line. We will inform you about updates of the system. No other use will be made of the information.
    Mirror sites: Are being developed. 

Use of Leibniz System
Getting going is much easier if the user first reads Preface and Chapters 1 and 2 of leibnizmanual.pdf in directory Leibniz/Manual. Yes, we know, "A manual is just another person's opinion," but maybe here the opinion counts.
